Even though we had a whole lecture dedicated to pointers, I think this lab really made it easy to understand how pointers worked as 
my learning method of choice is to experiment with said function to understand how it works and this lab enabled that.

I found task 1 extremely difficult. I did not understand how to get a strings length with a for loop but with some research I was able to solve the problem.

I didn't have as much problems with this lab as the last one but it still offered a challenge. With that said i think this lab is the best
balanced yet, challenging yet doable and tips that saved me from hours of despair.

Estimated time spent 10hrs.
